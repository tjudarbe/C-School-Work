1.) A function is a block of code that performas a procedure or routine. 
    Every function has parameters. These parameters hold values and are passed on when you call the
    function in the main body of the program. However functions can contain no values in their parameters.
    The functions are important to have in any programming language because it organizes your code.
    Instead of having all the code in one body functions allow us to seperate them and organize our code
    which makes it easier to debug our programs especially for big projects.

2.) I think the hlper functions are in a different module because they return void and in the 
    contacts module the functions are returning values.
